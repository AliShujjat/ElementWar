# ElementWar

This is a project I submitted for my course CS 224 - OOP & Design Methodologies. The idea was a simple game where users could pass through different levels and either shoot or jump over incoming enemies. 

The project was coded using xcode as the IDE and C++ for my primary programming lanuage along with the [SDL 2.0 library](https://www.libsdl.org/)
